# Hamming Code Implementation

The codes in this reporitory consists in:

1 - Parity check in PROLOG.

2 - Hamming code implementation in Prolog language.

The code consists of detecting and correcting errors in a sequence of bits.
If more error-correcting bits are included with a message, and if those bits can be arranged such that different incorrect bits produce different error results, then bad bits could be identified. In a seven-bit message, there are seven possible single bit errors, so three error control bits could potentially specify not only that an error occurred but also which bit caused the error.
